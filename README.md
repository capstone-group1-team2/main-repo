# Agentic Customer Support Assistant

## Problem Statement
 
Customer support conversations mix two fundamentally different needs: a
question that just needs an accurate explanation, and a request that
needs a real action taken. Most simple chatbots treat both the same way
— and worse, most don't know when to admit they can't help and hand off
to a human instead of guessing.
 
This project builds a customer support agent that:
 
- **Understands intent.** Tells the difference between an information
  request and an action request, and routes each correctly.
- **Answers with evidence.** Information questions are answered using
  retrieval-grounded generation over a real knowledge base (Weaviate
  dense + keyword search, fused with a Neo4j concept graph) — with a
  self-check that verifies the generated answer is actually supported by
  what was retrieved before it's ever sent back to the customer.
- **Acts, not just describes.** Action requests (cancel or track an
  order) call real functions against a mock order store, rather than
  producing a plausible-sounding description of what it would do.
- **Knows its limits.** Anything it isn't confident about is escalated
  to a human, logged permanently, and posted live to a Slack channel —
  instead of fabricating an answer or guessing at an action.
Full technical design: **[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)** — the
single source of truth for this project. This README summarizes; it
doesn't duplicate that document.

## Architecture Summary
 
```
data/          raw dataset (never edited) + finalized corpus + mock order store
ingestion/     chunking, embedding, Weaviate/Neo4j loading (python -m ingestion.ingest)
retrieval/     hybrid (BM25 + dense) retrieval, graph-based query broadening
agent/         intent classification, generation, groundedness, routing, escalation
app/           FastAPI backend (/chat /health /metrics /escalations)
frontend/      Next.js chat UI
eval/          held-out set, plain-RAG baseline, evaluation harness
scripts/       fetch_data.py (dataset download), build_corpus.py (historical reference only)
```
 
At a glance: an incoming message is classified by intent and slot-extracted
in one call to Groq's free-tier LLM API. Information questions flow through
hybrid retrieval → generation → a local groundedness check, retried once
via graph-broadened retrieval before ever escalating. Action requests call
real functions against the mock order store. Anything low-confidence,
ungrounded, or unresolvable triggers escalation: a clarifying question is
asked first, contact info is captured, and the escalation is logged and
posted to Slack.
 
Full annotated file tree, data flow, and every routing decision are
documented in **[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)**.

## How to Run Locally
 
A complete, beginner-friendly walkthrough — with Windows, macOS, and
Linux instructions, and expected output at every step — lives in
**[SETUP.md](SETUP.md)**. It's designed to take a new machine from zero
to a fully running chat interface in under 30 minutes.
 
Quickest path, if you're already comfortable with the stack:
 
```bash
cp .env.example .env            # fill in GROQ_API_KEY, NEO4J_PASSWORD (SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL optional)
docker compose up -d weaviate neo4j redis
 
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
 
python -m ingestion.ingest       # populates Weaviate + Neo4j from data/corpus/
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 &
 
cd frontend
cp .env.local.example .env.local
npm install && npm run dev
```
 
Then visit `http://localhost:3000`.
 
See **[SETUP.md](SETUP.md)** for the full step-by-step guide, and
**[RUN.md](RUN.md)** for advanced usage: running the backend alone,
Docker-only startup, ingestion internals, and the test suite.
